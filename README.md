# Cancer-Prediction
ML project - Cervical cancer prediction

University project done in the context of my ML course during the Masterâ€™s Degree, rated with full marks.
The focus of this Machine Learning project is Classification Analysis, with specific reference to all its phases: Data Input, Preprocessing (Discretization, Missing Replacement, Data Exploration, Partitioning and Oversampling), Data Modeling (Probabilistic Models, Heuristic Models, Separation Classifiers, Regression Models, Neural Networks), Models Evaluation (Cross Validation, Precision, Recall, F1 measure, ROC Curve). 

To develope this Classification Analysis we used KNIME Analytics Platform, an open source software for creating data science applications and services. 

Case study: we analyzed the impact of cervical cancer on the female population, highlighting the factors that most affect the onset of the disease.
